# Example

Example app of the Stick It package. Demonstrates how to use the package.
You can find the two examples of Stick It placed in the /screens directory.

SimplestExample is the fastest way to make use of the package without any optional parameters or function calls.

AdvancedExample will show a more thorough use-case. It shows how to export an image out of the user composition
and how to use the optional parameters. For saving the image within the gallery of the device the flutter package [gallery_saver](https://pub.dev/packages/gallery_saver) is used,
which you don't need for the usage of Stick It, but is a nice addition.
